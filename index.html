        <h2 id="coursesummary"> Course Summary  </h2>
          <p> This course requires students to compose digital media while exploring the rhetorical, poetic, and political
            implications of multiple writing platforms. Students will learn how to compose a range
            of critical media objects using web-authorizing languages, text, sound, images,
            and video in proprietary and open-source software. Classes will focus on theories of
            writing, composing, design, critique, delivery, and netowrked distributions;
            critique and analysis of digital media produced by professional and amateur digital media
            practitioners; and analysis and revisions of digital media composed by the students themselves.
