        <h2 id="coursesummary"> Course Summary  </h2>
          <p> This course requires students to compose digital media while exploring the rhetorical, poetic, and political
            implications of multiple writing platforms. Students will learn how to compose a range
            of critical media objects using web-authorizing languages, text, sound, images,
            and video in proprietary and open-source software. Classes will focus on theories of
            writing, composing, design, critique, delivery, and netowrked distributions;
            critique and analysis of digital media produced by professional and amateur digital media
            practitioners; and analysis and revisions of digital media composed by the students themselves.
            </p>

          </h2>
          <p> Arrange layers of sound to convey a sense of place and story. The genre of the narrative
            you convey is open: it could be a documentary, fictional, even science-fictional. The two main
            goals are to learn how to capture sound and edit it using digital tools and to explore
            the affordances of sound as a medium, with particular attention to its ability
            to communicate immersive environment and narrative pacing and change.

          </h2>
          <p> Make a rhetorical intervention through the juxtaposition of images and text.
            It's a collage, but with an argument to make. The two main goals are to
            learn how to ethically obtain images and edit them using digital tools and to explore
            the affordances of still images as a medium, and especially their ability
            to direct attention and help make ideas memorable.

          <p> Build a multi-page website using basic html and css files, along with any
            media assets you wish to embed. The two main goals are to learn how to manage
            a composite project made up of multiple interlinking files and to explore the affordances
            of the web design stack as a medium and especially its ability to flexibly render content
            for multiple audiences or reading priorities.
