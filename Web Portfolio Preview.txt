For my website portfolio, I plan to highlight my soundscape narrative and visual argument projects. I plan to include everything on one page with different hyperlinks to different sections of the page for easy access. I plan to use this website as a place where prospective students look to see what exactly they’ll be doing if they decide to take this class. I plan to include images and audio to make the experience more immersive and I also plan to highlight the different class attributes/gen-ed requirements this class can fulfill to encourage more people to take it even if they aren’t design or CS students.
